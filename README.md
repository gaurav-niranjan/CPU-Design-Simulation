This project was made as a part of Computer Organization and Architecture Course<br /><br />

Instruction Set Architecture Design is described in ISA_Design.pdf <br /><br />
TKGate is required to open design_file.v <br />
sudo apt-get install tkgate   <br />

CPU instructions for testing are in instruction_test_file.mem file <br />
<br />
